#####Goal
The goal of this project is to present Spring Cloud Openfeign. Openfeign is REST client tool - it enables connection with REST API.

We have here 2 REST API Spring Boot projects:
* **Custom Text Service**: provides greeting text in many languages;
* **Custom Greeting Service**: connects greeting text with name.

#####Used technologies:

* Remove class RestConfig: RestTemplate won't be used any more;
* Update class Application: add annotation @EnableFeignClients with path to root package (or package with clients);
* Create interface CustomTextServiceClient: this client should have exactly the same method as CustomTextService;
* Update class GreetingController: remove RestTEmplate and use CustomTextServiceClient.
